# ⚡ Energy Anomaly Detection System

An end-to-end Machine Learning project for detecting energy consumption anomalies in commercial buildings using Isolation Forest and deployed as an interactive Streamlit dashboard.

---

## 💻 Project Overview

Commercial buildings consume ~30% of global energy, generating billions in operational costs annually.

Unexpected energy spikes due to:
- Equipment failures
- Operational inefficiencies
- Occupancy mismatches
- System faults

This project builds a multivariate time-series anomaly detection system to automatically detect abnormal energy usage patterns.

##  How It Works 🤔

1. Load energy datasets (Electricity, Hot Water, Chilled Water)
2. Clean & preprocess time-series data
3. Generate statistical and temporal features
4. Train Isolation Forest model
5. Detect anomalies
6. Visualize anomalies in interactive dashboard
